Subject: [PATCH] Fix balance regression in 4.4-rc

There's a regression in 4.4-rc since commit bc3094673f22
(btrfs: extend balance filter usage to take minimum and maximum) in that
existing (non-ranged) balance with -dusage=x no longer works; all chunks
are skipped.

After staring at the code for a while and wondering why a non-ranged
balance would even need min and max thresholds (..which then were not
set correctly, leading to the bug) I realized that the only problem
was the fact that the filter functions were named wrong, thanks to
patching copypasta. Simply renaming both functions lets the existing
btrfs-progs call balance with -dusage=x and now the non-ranged filter
function is invoked, properly using only a single chunk limit.
