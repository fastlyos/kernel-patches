Subject: [PATCH v2 1/2] xfs: exclude never-released buffers from buftarg I/O accounting
Date: Fri, 15 Jul 2016 14:35:33 -0400

The upcoming buftarg I/O accounting mechanism maintains a count of all
buffers that have undergone I/O in the current hold-release cycle.
Certain buffers associated with core infrastructure (e.g., the xfs_mount
superblock buffer, log buffers) are never released, however. This means
that accounting I/O submission on such buffers elevates the buftarg
count indefinitely and could lead to lockup on unmount.

Define a new buffer flag to explicitly exclude buffers from buftarg I/O
accounting. Set the flag on the superblock and associated log buffers.
