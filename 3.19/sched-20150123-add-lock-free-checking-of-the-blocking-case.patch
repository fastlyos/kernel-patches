Subject: sched/completion: Add lock-free checking of the blocking case

The "thread would block" case can be checked without grabbing ->wait.lock.

[ If the check does not return early then grab the lock and recheck.
  A memory barrier is not needed as complete() and complete_all() imply
  a barrier.

  The ACCESS_ONCE() is needed for calls in a loop that, if inlined, could
  optimize out the re-fetching of x->done. ]
