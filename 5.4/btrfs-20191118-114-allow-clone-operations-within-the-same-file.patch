Subject: [PATCH 114/137] Btrfs: send, allow clone operations within the same file

For send we currently skip clone operations when the source and
destination files are the same. This is so because clone didn't support
this case in its early days, but support for it was added back in May
2013 by commit a96fbc72884fcb ("Btrfs: allow file data clone within a
file"). This change adds support for it.

Example:

  $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdd
  $ mount /dev/sdd /mnt/sdd

  $ xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xab -b 64K 0 64K" /mnt/sdd/foobar
  $ xfs_io -c "reflink /mnt/sdd/foobar 0 64K 64K" /mnt/sdd/foobar

  $ btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /mnt/sdd /mnt/sdd/snap

  $ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sde
  $ mount /dev/sde /mnt/sde

  $ btrfs send /mnt/sdd/snap | btrfs receive /mnt/sde

Without this change file foobar at the destination has a single 128Kb
extent:

  $ filefrag -v /mnt/sde/snap/foobar
  Filesystem type is: 9123683e
  File size of /mnt/sde/snap/foobar is 131072 (32 blocks of 4096 bytes)
   ext:     logical_offset:        physical_offset: length:   expected: flags:
     0:        0..      31:          0..        31:     32:             last,unknown_loc,delalloc,eof
  /mnt/sde/snap/foobar: 1 extent found

With this we get a single 64Kb extent that is shared at file offsets 0
and 64K, just like in the source filesystem:

  $ filefrag -v /mnt/sde/snap/foobar
  Filesystem type is: 9123683e
  File size of /mnt/sde/snap/foobar is 131072 (32 blocks of 4096 bytes)
   ext:     logical_offset:        physical_offset: length:   expected: flags:
     0:        0..      15:       3328..      3343:     16:             shared
     1:       16..      31:       3328..      3343:     16:       3344: last,shared,eof
  /mnt/sde/snap/foobar: 2 extents found
