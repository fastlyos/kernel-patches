+ * Extent buffer locking
+ * =====================
+ *
+ * The locks use a custom scheme that allows to do more operations than are
+ * available fromt current locking primitives. The building blocks are still
+ * rwlock and wait queues.
+ *
+ * Required semantics:
+ *
+ * - reader/writer exclusion
+ * - writer/writer exclusion
+ * - reader/reader sharing
+ * - spinning lock semantics
+ * - blocking lock semantics
+ * - try-lock semantics for readers and writers
+ * - one level nesting, allowing read lock to be taken by the same thread that
+ *   already has write lock
+ *
+ * The extent buffer locks (also called tree locks) manage access to eb data
+ * related to the storage in the b-tree (keys, items, but not the individual
+ * members of eb).
+ * We want concurrency of many readers and safe updates. The underlying locking
+ * is done by read-write spinlock and the blocking part is implemented using
+ * counters and wait queues.
+ *
+ * spinning semantics - the low-level rwlock is held so all other threads that
+ *                      want to take it are spinning on it.
+ *
+ * blocking semantics - the low-level rwlock is not held but the counter
+ *                      denotes how many times the blocking lock was held;
+ *                      sleeping is possible
+ *
+ * Write lock always allows only one thread to access the data.
+ *
+ *
+ * Debugging
+ * ---------
+ *
+ * There are additional state counters that are asserted in various contexts,
+ * removed from non-debug build to reduce extent_buffer size and for
+ * performance reasons.
+ *
+ *
+ * Lock nesting
+ * ------------
+ *
+ * A write operation on a tree might indirectly start a look up on the same
+ * tree.  This can happen when btrfs_cow_block locks the tree and needs to
+ * lookup free extents.
+ *
+ * btrfs_cow_block
+ *   ..
+ *   alloc_tree_block_no_bg_flush
+ *     btrfs_alloc_tree_block
+ *       btrfs_reserve_extent
+ *         ..
+ *         load_free_space_cache
+ *           ..
+ *           btrfs_lookup_file_extent
+ *             btrfs_search_slot
+ *
+ *
+ * Locking pattern - spinning
+ * --------------------------
+ *
+ * The simple locking scenario, the +--+ denotes the spinning section.
+ *
+ * +- btrfs_tree_lock
+ * | - extent_buffer::rwlock is held
+ * | - no heavy operations should happen, eg. IO, memory allocations, large
+ * |   structure traversals
+ * +- btrfs_tree_unock
+*
+*
+ * Locking pattern - blocking
+ * --------------------------
+ *
+ * The blocking write uses the following scheme.  The +--+ denotes the spinning
+ * section.
+ *
+ * +- btrfs_tree_lock
+ * |
+ * +- btrfs_set_lock_blocking_write
+ *
+ *   - allowed: IO, memory allocations, etc.
+ *
+ * -- btrfs_tree_unlock - note, no explicit unblocking necessary
+ *
+ *
+ * Blocking read is similar.
+ *
+ * +- btrfs_tree_read_lock
+ * |
+ * +- btrfs_set_lock_blocking_read
+ *
+ *  - heavy operations allowed
+ *
+ * +- btrfs_tree_read_unlock_blocking
+ * |
+ * +- btrfs_tree_read_unlock
+ *
