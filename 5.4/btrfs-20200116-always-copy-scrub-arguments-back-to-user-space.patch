Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: always copy scrub arguments back to user space
Date:   Thu, 16 Jan 2020 11:29:20 +0000

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

If scrub returns an error we are not copying back the scrub arguments
structure to user space. This prevents user space to know how much progress
scrub has done if an error happened - this includes -ECANCELED which is
returned when users ask for scrub to stop. A particular use case, which is
used in btrfs-progs, is to resume scrub after it is canceled, in that case
it relies on checking the progress from the scrub arguments structure and
then use that progress in a call to resume scrub.

So fix this by always copying the scrub arguments structure to user space,
overwriting the value returned to user space with -EFAULT only if copying
the structure failed to let user space know that either that copying did
not happen, and therefore the structure is stale, or it happened partially
and the structure is probably not valid and corrupt due to the partial
copy.
