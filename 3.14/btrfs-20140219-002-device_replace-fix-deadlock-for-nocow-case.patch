Subject: Btrfs: device_replace: fix deadlock for nocow case

commit cb7ab02156e4 cause a following deadlock found by
xfstests,btrfs/011:

Thread1 is commiting transaction which is blocked at
btrfs_scrub_pause().

Thread2 is calling btrfs_file_aio_write() which has held
inode's @i_mutex and commit transaction(blocked because
Thread1 is committing transaction).

Thread3 is copy_nocow_page worker which will also try to
hold inode @i_mutex, so thread3 will wait Thread1 finished.

Thread4 is waiting pending workers finished which will wait
Thread3 finished. So the problem is like this:

Thread1--->Thread4--->Thread3--->Thread2---->Thread1

Deadlock happens! we fix it by letting Thread1 go firstly,
which means we won't block transaction commit while we are
waiting pending workers finished.
