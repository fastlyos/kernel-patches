Subject: [1/2] xfs: write unmount record for ro mounts

There are dueling comments in the xfs code about intent
for log writes when unmounting a readonly filesystem.

In xfs_mountfs, we see the intent:

/*
 * Now the log is fully replayed, we can transition to full read-only
 * mode for read-only mounts. This will sync all the metadata and clean
 * the log so that the recovery we just performed does not have to be
 * replayed again on the next mount.
 */

and it calls xfs_quiesce_attr(), but by the time we get to 
xfs_log_unmount_write(), it returns early for a RDONLY mount:

 * Don't write out unmount record on read-only mounts.

Because of this, sequential ro mounts of a filesystem with
a dirty log will replay the log each time, which seems odd.

Fix this by writing an unmount record even for RO mounts, as long
as norecovery wasn't specified (don't write a clean log record
if a dirty log may still be there!) and the log device is
writable.
