Subject: [PATCH v2 1/7] xfs: print transaction log reservation on overrun
Date:   Thu, 30 Nov 2017 13:58:30 -0500

The transaction dump code displays the content and reservation
consumption of a particular transaction in the event of an overrun.
It currently displays the reservation associated with the
transaction ticket, but not the original reservation attached to the
transaction.

The latter value reflects the original transaction reservation
calculation before additional reservation overhead is assigned, such
as for the CIL context header and potential split region headers.

Update xlog_print_trans() to also print the original transaction
reservation in the event of overrun. This provides a reference point
to identify how much reservation overhead was added to a particular
ticket by xfs_log_calc_unit_res().
