Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: always use trans->block_rsv for orphans
Date:	Fri, 27 May 2016 13:01:08 -0400

This is the case all the time anyway except for relocation which could be doing
a reloc root for a non ref counted root, in which case we'd end up with some
random block rsv rather than the one we have our reservation in.  If there isn't
enough space in the block rsv we are trying to steal from we'll BUG() because we
expect there to be space for the orphan to make its reservation.  Thanks,
