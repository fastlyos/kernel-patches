Subject: [btrfs] fix check_direct_IO() for non-iovec iterators

looking for duplicate ->iov_base makes sense only for
iovec-backed iterators; for kvec-backed ones it's pointless,
for bvec-backed ones it's pointless and broken on 32bit (we
walk through an array of struct bio_vec accessing them as if
they were struct iovec; works by accident on 64bit, but on
32bit it'll blow up) and for pipe-backed ones it's pointless
and ends up oopsing.
